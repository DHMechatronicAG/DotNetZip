<h1>DotNetZip works with the .NET Compact Framework</h1>

<p>As of v1.7.1.10, DotNetZip runs on the .NET Compact Framework v3.5.
There is a special reduced version of the library that runs on smart
devices.  </p>

<p>The programming model is exactly the same as for the regular
DotNetZip library. There are a few differences in operation.</p>

<ol>

<li> The .NET Compact Framework lacks a SetLastModifiedTime() method on
the System.IO.File class. Therefore, when your .NET CF application
unzips a zip archive, the unzipped files will not have the file times
set properly.  

<li>The CF version of DotNetZip is not able to produce Self-extracting
archives.  The ZipFile.SaveSelfExtractor() method is not available in
the CF version of DotNetZip.

</ol>

<h2>Using DotNetZip in a Smart Device project</h2>

<p> To build a smart device application that uses DotNetZip, you will
need to use Visual Studio 2008 or later.  </p>

<ol>

<li>Open Visual Studio 2008.
</li>

<li>Create a smart device project.  Specify that it will use the .NET
Compact Framework v3.5.  This is required in order to get the
Compression libraries. </li>

<li>Add a Reference to the CF Library for DotNetZip.  
The filename is Ionic.Utils.Zip.CF.dll </li>

<li>Build your application as normal. </li>

</ol>


<h2>About the Project Design</h2>

<p> The CF-Library project in the DotNetZip source distribution includes
all of the source files as <i>Links</i> to the original files in the
Library project.  This means, the source files are not duplicated. Any
changes need to be made only once.  The CF-Library project is simply a
"build project" in that regard. There is no additional source code
specifically for the .NET Compact Framework.  </p>

<p>NETCF is defined as a conditional compile symbol for the CF-Library
project.  This symbol is used in the source to exclude code that will
not run on the .NET Compact Framework, for example, the calls to
SetLastModifiedTime() method on the System.IO.File class.  </p>
